# BINGO Game

A console-based BINGO game implemented in C++ with resume functionality and support for boards up to 25x25.

## Description

This project is a BINGO game implemented in C++, designed to be played in the console. The game allows players to generate BINGO boards of various sizes, ranging from the standard 5x5 to a maximum size of 25x25. Players can play the game and mark off numbers as they are called. The game supports the functionality to save the game state and resume it later.It was my first semester project so there's no use of dynamic memory allocation.

## How to Play

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable file generated after compilation.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate a BINGO board.
4. Play the game by marking off numbers as they are called.
5. Save the game state at any time to resume it later.

## Features

- Generate BINGO boards of various sizes (up to 25x25).
- Play the game by marking off numbers as they are called.
- Save and resume game state functionality.
- Console-based interface for easy interaction.

## Usage

- To generate a BINGO board, follow the on-screen instructions.
- During gameplay, follow the prompts to mark off numbers or save the game state.
- To resume a saved game, simply run the executable and select the resume option.

## Development

This project is written in C++ and can be compiled using any standard C++ compiler. It follows a modular design, with separate files for different components such as board generation, gameplay, and file I/O for saving and loading game states.
